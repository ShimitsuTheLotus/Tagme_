# Tagme_
A file classfying program based on SQLite.
Now is not finished. It's in build now.

We're finding ways to make Tagme_ Run on the Tagme_Core... Thus it'll be easy to make some changes.

Feel free to ask and help with us! **If you want to help, there's a help request list below.**

## Help request
- [ ] Test with back button, **if the program can go back after back button pressed**? (Some special type of windows devices will have a back button, such as Windows phone(though this program dosen't support Windows Phone since some control features used), and some devices originally installed Android system(I once saw a Android pad reinstalled with windows. the back button could work, so I believe I should support it. Unfortunatly, I don't have a device like that).
  1. Open settings(yes, windows settings)
  1. Test if your back button works, if not, your back button won't work, there's no need to continue
  1. Open Tagme_ to test.
  1. Tell me if it works.

### Requirements for using Tagme_CoreUWP
