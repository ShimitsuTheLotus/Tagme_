- I've finished to add a motion to the program title when creating database.

### Feb. 16 2024
- I finished reorder the layout when window size changed. Now it looks perfect.
### Feb. 21 2024
- I finished letting two buttons resizing to fit the window.
### Feb. 23 2024
- I find a way to solve the problem that after changing the color of TextBlock, the TextBlock can hardly resolve its color theme to the default: it could change its color automatically to fit the dark/light theme. The solution is: new a TextBlock and replace the original. However, it caused other problems, some codes setting the properties of the TextBlock will not make any difference. I found the problem and updated my UWP notes: https://github.com/ShimizuTheLotus/ShimizuTheLotus/blob/main/Note/UWP/CS%20And%20UI.md
### Feb. 26 2024
- I solved the reposition animation of the TextBlock when the text changed by putting it in a non child animation panel.
### Mar. 4 2024
- I added some code to preview the style of database list.
### Mar. 6 2024
- I tried to run ver 2 build of Tagme_ and found it lost its certification.
