- I've finished to add a motion to the program title when creating database.
- I've finished to solve the problem of global go back button. I also shared the template I made in my repo at: https://github.com/ShimizuTheLotus/GlobalBackButtonTemplate
- I've lost all my documents of Tagme_ ver 3 since a sync bug of OneNote.
